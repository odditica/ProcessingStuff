# ProcessingStuff
A showcase of some of my experimental Processing sketches.

All graphical assets made by myself (such as models, textures, exported GIFs) in this repository are licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). 

I am currently trying to figure out the most appropriate licence for the code, until then, **it remains protected under copyright** (forking is obviously still allowed by default). Please note that the main purpose of this repository is to show my work, the code is not very well suited to be used in other projects.

Please ask for permission before releasing remixes of my sketches outside of forks of this repository.
